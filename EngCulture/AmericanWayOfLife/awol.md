> What is the biggest slum in the U.S. and why?

---


> There are certainly areas with high poverty and high crime. But even low income areas have electricity and running water. They're hardly "slums".Americans don't call them slums anymore. Now they're called "low income housing" or "substandard housing". Basically, poor houses and slums. They can be found in the inner city. And none of American politicians lift a finger for those folks.

But the USA has a problem of homeless people, and I'm not sure which is worse - to not have a place to call home at all, or to have one in a slum.  Both are undesirable to any nation, but particularly negative on one of the most wealthy nations in the world.
---
In Los Angeles alone, there are around 90,000 homeless people.  They're spread out and since no 'slum' is allowed to come up, they are practically everywhere they're not removed from.

> Sure the USA doesn't really have slums.  But there are pockets of poverty dotting pretty much every major city, in which people somehow survive.  There is much difficulty in accomplishing this in the colder areas of course.
---
> Many places in the USA have laws against living like this!  Not many other nations would think of sanitizing their countries of their own people.

Thirty-eight percent of employees said they sometimes live paycheck-to-paycheck, 17 percent said they usually do and 23 percent said they always do.

Meanwhile, 57% of households say they can't afford to save even $100 a month.

> Erwin pointed to two trends that continue to put financial stress on households: stagnant wages and the rising cost of everything from education to many consumer goods.
 
> "Living paycheck to paycheck is the new way of life for U.S. workers," he said. "It's not just one salary range. It's pretty much across the board, and it's trending in the wrong direction."
 
<!-- A year ago, about 75 percent of U.S. workers said they were living from payday to payday, a number that has grown to 78 percent this year. The study, conducted by Harris Poll, surveyed nearly 2,400 hiring and human resource managers and 3,500 adult employees who worked full-time in May and June. -->

Per the following chart from howmuch.net, the average American family spends roughly $57,000 per year and have thrown caution to the wind with housing costs eating up nearly 33% of annual budgets.  In all, some 40 million houses (or about 1/3) are occupied by people who can't afford them.

Of course, this is hardly surprising in light of the following chart which reveals that the average working class family can't afford to live in the majority of metropolitan cities around the country due to ballooning housing costs.

Meanwhile, the following data from Harvard found that over 18 million households are currently stuck spending more than 50% of their annual income on housing, which is up 35% compared to 2001 levels. 
---
> Although the total number of households with severe burdens also fell somewhat from 19.3 million in 2014 to 18.8 million in 2015, the improvement was again on the owner side (Figure 5). Indeed, 11.1 million renter households were severely cost burdened in 2015, a 3.7 million increase from 2001. By comparison, 7.6 million owners were severely burdened in 2015, up 1.1 million from 2001.

## Homeless
> Just like during the last economic crisis, homeless encampments are popping up all over the nation as poverty grows at a very alarming rate.  According to the Department of Housing and Urban Development, more than half a million people are homeless in America right now, but that figure is increasing by the day.  And it isn’t just adults that we are talking about. 
---
> It has been reported that that the number of homeless children in this country has risen by 60 percent since the last recession, and Poverty USA says that a total of 1.6 million children slept either in a homeless shelter or in some other form of emergency housing at some point last year.  Yes, the stock market may have been experiencing a temporary boom for the last couple of years, but for those on the low end of the economic scale things have just continued to deteriorate.
