## Media preference about myself

As a university student, the main way for me to contact with the latest things in the world is the mobile internet, for it can be accessed at nearly every time in a day. Therefore, the main types of media that influence me are all related to mobile internet. These types of media include forums about some special topics, like NGA (a forum made up by game lovers) and s1stage (a fourm consists of comic lovers), online video website like Bilibili (a Danmu video share platform) as well as live streaming like Douyu (Chinese counterpart of Twitch). But in my opinion, the most influencial media what we called social media. The new form of media makes it possible for every individual to be the source of information, to share their views with other people, to get attention they can not get in the ordinary life. Though it is hard to admit, I usually spend more than an hour on social media everyday, which means it is not only an important source of information, but also a great distraction for me from my schoolwork.

## Visual Media preference about university students

For university students in this era, as mentioned above, social media over mobile internet makes up a huge part of their daily contact with media. Students take part in the discussions online by reading and writing online. In addition to social media, video websites are also popular among students, which is a substitution for TV among the young people. In addition to these two popular media, different students may have different preference. For instance, some of the students may enjoy watching live streaming and browse forums while others may enjoy reading books borrowed from the library. As for video games, in some ways it can also be defined as a kind of media, are also popular among students. In conclusion, we can find that almost everything is related to the Internet, and because almost everything on the Internet have something to show on screen, vision is the most important way for students to access to the new media in Internet age.

refugees
2017 oct
around Mosul

With the attack for retaking Mosul by the anti-ISIL allies, thousands of refugees fled from the battle field around Mosul in october, 2017. Refugees' camps were set near the conflict area to accommodate these refugees. After the rough but sweet journey on boat or foot, these people can finally get rid of the veils and taboos laid on them by ISIL, and reunited with their beloved family members.

The man in the picture was once fined for smoking in ISIL controled area and threatened to be executed the next time. Now he has already fled from the control of ISIL, yet with no money, no house left.
