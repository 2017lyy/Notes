## Introduction 

With the fast development of the mobile Internet, more and more people are using online taken-out food platform to order food. According to the report of Institute of Frontier Industry Research in 2016, the whole market of online taken-out selling will reach at 118 billion yuan per year at the end of 2017. Meanwhile, the dramatically growing Big Data technology and the Mobile Internet technology are putting a more and more powerful impact on traditional food markets (iiMedia Research, 2016). The trend of the growing of the O2O food market is unstoppable and it is easy to predict that the market will grow even faster in the following few years (iiMedia Research, 2017). Above all, it is obvious that buying online taken-out food is becoming a natural part of urban citizens' life.

Among all the people who buy taken-out online, students are the very first group of people who use online platform for taken-out as soon as they came out, and still an unignoreable part of people who buy food online (TrustData, 2017). In other words, students are the first target group for online taken-out platform and still an important target market of these platforms. TrustData find a strong relationship on the number of taken-out orders and the number of universities, which also suggests that students consumed a large number of online taken-out. However, among all the exist researches, there is no report to show the math model of university students' taken-out ordering pattern. There have already been many reports focus on the whole market of taken-out, but not detailed enough to show the buying pattern in campus. There are also reports made by other universityâ€™s' students, while they simply sent some questionnaires and make some simple guesses on the result, which is not enough to reveal the whole pattern of campus online taken-out buying.

Our research is focused on the Data get from UCAS Yuquan campus. With the help of data analysis algorithm offered by Weka, is it easier to find out the pattern of online taken-out buying and the relationships between all these factors.
